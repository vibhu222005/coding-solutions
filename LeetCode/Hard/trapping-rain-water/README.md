![Hard](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red) | [View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

## Problem

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

 
Example 1:

Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.


Example 2:

Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9


 
Constraints:


	n == height.length
	1 <= n <= 2 * 104
	0 <= height[i] <= 105

**Example 1:**
```
Input:  height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

**Example 2:**
```
Input:  height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```

## Constraints
