## Problem

You are given an integer array arr[]. For every element in the array, determine its Previous Greater Element (PGE).

The Previous Greater Element (PGE) of an element x is the first element that appears to the left of x in the array and is strictly greater than x.

Note: If no such element exists, assign -1 as the PGE for that position.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [10, 4, 2, 20, 40, 12, 30]
Output: [-1, 10, 4, -1, -1, 40, 40]
Explanation:
For 10, no elements on the left, so answer is -1.
For 4, previous greater element is 10.
For 2, previous greater element is 4.
For 20, no element on the left greater than 20, so answer is -1.
For 40, no element on the left greater than 40, so answer is -1.
For 12, previous greater element is 40.
For 30, previous greater element is 40.

Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30, 40]
Output: [-1, -1, -1, -1]
Explanation: Each element of the array has no previous greater element.

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
